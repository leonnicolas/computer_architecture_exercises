# Computer Architecture Exercises
These are a couple small exercises focused on the intel x86\_64 architecture that I am making for a friend. They are all very short, but can help understand more of the following topics:
- CPU registers
- calling convention (System V AMD64 ABI)
- arrays
- Jumps
- C strings
- C runtime
- I will add some more over time

## Structure of each Exercise
There will always be one or more programming exercises. You will have to write assembler code. Most of the time, there will be some wrapper written in C to call the functions that you wrote in nasm. Possible solutions are included.
Additionally, there can be a couple questions and some information to be able to write the assembler code without too much googling.

## What you need
- a Linux operating system
- C compiler, I used gcc in all exercises
- nasm, for compiling your assembler code
